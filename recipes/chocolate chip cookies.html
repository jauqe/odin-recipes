<p>There are a few secrets to the best classic, chewy chocolate chip cookies. Number one: Don’t use chips; instead, opt for a mix of milk or semisweet and dark chocolate chunks. The second is to let the dough rest overnight or longer for a more complex, toffee-like flavor. Lastly, use an ice cream scooper to get even-sized cookies every time. And that’s it! With these little tweaks, the result is a cookie that’s textured on the outside, and soft and gooey on the inside. Absolutely perfect!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>½ cup <strong>granulated sugar(100 g)</strong></li>
<li>¾ cup <strong>brown sugar(165 g)</strong>, packed</li>
<li>1 teaspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
<li>½ cup <strong>unsalted butter(115 g), melted</strong></li>
<li>1 <strong>egg</strong></li>
<li>1 teaspoon<strong> vanilla extract</strong></li>
<li>1 ¼ cups <strong>all-purpose flour(155 g)</strong></li>
<li>½ teaspoon <strong>baking soda</strong></li>
<li>4 oz <strong>milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)</strong></li>
<li>4 oz <strong>dark chocolate chunk(110 g)</strong>, or your preference</li>
</ul>


<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
    <br>
    <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
